# Tic Tac Toe mods

# Introduction (~15 minutes)
##  Show how game works on the whiteboard
* Board spots 1-9
* Vocab words: spot, marker, row, column, cross.  
* Actually have two students play (manually) and walk through what the variables would be during their game play.

## Walk through the first three functions

## Run through a game students vs computer opponent
* In browser vs simple computer opponent
* Call on random student to make the next choice
* Calculate the row/col/cross variables on the whiteboard in between steps

## Walk through the main game loop
* At the bottom of code

# Split into groups (1 minute)
* Minimum 2 students, maximum 3 students

# Groups pick one of these three tasks (1 minute)
1. Creating a smarter computer opponent 
2. Customizing the look of the board and the in-game dialogue
3. Adding some modifications to the game:
    * Selecting which computer opponent to play
    * Adding random elements like losing a turn or randomly flipping the marker from X to O or vice versa
    * Add another game loop to continuously play while keeping a running total of games won/lost

# Planning (~5 minutes)
* Groups plan their strategy
* Once they are ready, they check in with a teacher/volunteer with their plan
* Once approved, they are given the source code (via ???)

# Programming in groups (45 minutes)
* Periodically checking in to see what is going well and what is not working
* Speedy groups can get prepared to demo

# Demos (Remainder)
* Groups who want to demonstrate their changes can first show them to a teacher/volunteer and then if approved, submit their code (via ???) and show it on the class screen.
